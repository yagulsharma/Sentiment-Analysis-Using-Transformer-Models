## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a critical task for understanding public opinions and sentiments in a wide variety of fields, from business to politics. This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline using transformer-based models, which are known for their ability to process sequential data and capture complex linguistic patterns.

Our approach uses the BERT model, a pre-trained transformer designed for language understanding. By fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification, we obtain highly accurate predictions, effectively identifying positive, negative, or neutral sentiments from textual data.

## Architecture

This project is built on a transformer-based architecture, specifically using the BERT model. BERT is a bi-directional model that reads text both forward and backward, allowing it to better capture the context of words in a sentence. The overall architecture follows a few key steps:

1. **Tokenization:** Text is first tokenized into smaller units using BERT's tokenizer. Special tokens like `[CLS]` (start of the sentence) and `[SEP]` (end of the sentence) are added.
2. **Embedding Layer:** Each token is converted into a dense vector embedding that BERT can process.
3. **Transformer Blocks:** BERT processes the tokenized input through multiple layers of transformer blocks, which include self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks.
4. **Output Layer:** The output from BERT is passed to a fully connected layer for classification into sentiment labels.

## Machine Learning Techniques

### Transformer Model (BERT)
The primary machine learning model used is BERT, which belongs to the transformer family. BERT uses self-attention mechanisms that enable it to capture dependencies between words irrespective of their position in the text. This allows for an efficient understanding of word context, which is vital for sentiment analysis.

Key aspects of BERT:

- **Self-attention:** This mechanism helps in capturing relationships between different parts of the text.
- **Pre-training:** BERT is pre-trained on large text corpora using masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction tasks.
- **Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained BERT model is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis using labeled datasets.

### Transfer Learning
We use transfer learning by taking a pre-trained BERT model and fine-tuning it on a smaller labeled dataset for sentiment analysis. This allows us to leverage the language understanding capabilities of BERT while training with fewer resources.

### Classification Layer
The output of the BERT model is passed to a simple fully connected neural network layer that classifies the text into one of the sentiment categories (positive, negative, or neutral).

### Loss Function
We use **Cross-Entropy Loss**, a common choice for classification problems, which helps in determining how well the model's predicted probability distribution matches the true distribution.

### Optimizer
The Adam optimizer with weight decay (AdamW) is used, which is known for its efficiency in fine-tuning large models like BERT.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning:** The text is cleaned by removing URLs, special characters, and extra spaces.
2. **Tokenization:** The BERT tokenizer is applied, which breaks the text into word pieces and maps them to corresponding token IDs.
3. **Padding/Truncating:** Each input sequence is padded to ensure uniform length, or truncated if the text exceeds the maximum length.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The training involves fine-tuning the BERT model on a sentiment-labeled dataset. The key steps include:

1. **Fine-Tuning:** The BERT model is trained on the dataset for a set number of epochs. The model weights are updated using backpropagation.
2. **Evaluation Metrics:** We use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance. These metrics help in understanding the model's ability to correctly predict the sentiment of the text.

## Results

The model achieves competitive results on the sentiment analysis task, with an F1-score of **91.68%** on the test data. This showcases the efficacy of transformer-based models like BERT for text classification tasks.
